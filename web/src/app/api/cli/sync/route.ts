 * POST /api/cli/sync — store one scan.
 *
 * The CLI re-uploads its whole history every run, so rows are upserted on
 * (user, day, tool, model, fast) and **replace** rather than accumulate. That
 * is what lets a corrected scan heal whatever the last one got wrong; without
 * it a second sync would double every number on the leaderboard.
 *
 * All of the logic lives in the backend service so this route and the
 * standalone server cannot drift apart.
 *
 * The upload is on the person's own profile as soon as this returns. The
 * leaderboard takes it in at the top of the next hour, so the reply says when,
 * and the rank it reports is the board's rather than a live figure the board
 * does not show yet.
