/**

 * Appwrite has no `GROUP BY` and no `SUM`, so the aggregation that used to be
 * SQL now happens here in memory over the raw rows. Two consequences worth
 * knowing:
 *
 *   - Board-wide functions work from a snapshot of every usage row, folded
 *     to (user, day, model) and refreshed hourly. See the cache section.
 *   - A profile page reads only that person's rows, directly and uncached, so
 *     a sync shows there at once.
 *
 * Days are plain `YYYY-MM-DD` strings in the reporter's own timezone, which is
 * what the CLI uploads. Comparing them as strings is therefore correct.
 *
 * Exported names and shapes match the SQLite layer this replaced; the only
 * change for callers is that the data functions are now async.
