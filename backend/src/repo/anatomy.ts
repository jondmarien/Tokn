/**
 * Where the money actually goes, and how well a user reuses what they paid to
 * cache.
 *
 * This exists because the intuition is wrong. Developers think "tokens" means
 * the prompt they typed and the reply they got. On a real Claude Code workload
 * those are a rounding error: cache is roughly nine tenths of the bill, and
 * output is under ten percent. No provider dashboard breaks it down this way,
 * because only the local session logs carry the per-bucket split.
 *
 * Two numbers come out of it:
 *
 *   anatomy    what each token bucket cost
 *   reuse      cached tokens read per cached token written
 *
 * Reuse is the actionable one. Writing to cache costs 1.25x the input rate at
 * a five-minute TTL and 2x at an hour; reading costs a tenth. A high ratio
 * means long sessions that keep re-reading a warm prefix. A low one means
 * paying the write premium again and again — starting over, clearing context,
 * or editing early turns and invalidating everything after them.
